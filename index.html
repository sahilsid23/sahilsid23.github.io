            <p class="subTag smallText">India is a developing nation. Although its economy is growing, poverty is still a major challenge. However, poverty is on the decline in India. It has around 84 million people living in extreme poverty which makes up 6% of its total population as of May 2021. In May 2012, the World Bank reviewed and proposed revisions to their poverty calculation methodology and purchasing power parity basis for measuring poverty worldwide. It was a minimal 3.6% in terms of percentage. As of 2020, the incidence of multidimensional poverty has significantly reduced from 54.7 percent in 2005 to 27.9 percent in 2015-16.According to United Nations Development Programme administrator Achim Steiner, India lifted 271 million people out of extreme poverty in a 10-year time period from 2005/06 to 2015/16. A 2020 study from the World Economic Forum found "Some 220 million Indians sustained on an expenditure level of less than Rs 32 / day — the poverty line for rural India — by the last headcount of the poor in India in 2013.</p>

            <p class="subTag smallText">Perhaps the earliest formal school was developed in Egypt's Middle Kingdom under
                the direction of Kheti, treasurer to Mentuhotep II.

                In Mesopotamia, the early logographic system of cuneiform script took many years to master. Thus only a
                limited number of individuals were hired as scribes to be trained in its reading and writing. Only royal
                offspring and sons of the rich and professionals such as scribes, physicians, and temple administrators,
                were schooled. Most boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed to learn a
                trade. Girls stayed at home with their mothers to learn housekeeping and cooking, and to
                look after the younger children. Later, when a syllabic script became more widespread, more of the
                Mesopotamian population became literate. Later still in Babylonian times there were libraries in most
                towns and temples; an old Sumerian proverb averred "he who would excel in the school of the scribes must
                rise with the dawn." There arose a whole social class of scribes, mostly employed in agriculture, but
                some as personal secretaries or lawyers</p>

            <p class="subTag smallText">Entrepreneurship is the creation or extraction of value.[1][2][3] With this definition, entrepreneurship is viewed as change, generally entailing risk beyond what is normally encountered in starting a business, which may include other values than simply economic ones.

                More narrow definitions have described entrepreneurship as the process of designing, launching and running a new business, which is often similar to a small business, or as the "capacity and willingness to develop, organize and manage a business venture along with any of its risks to make a profit."[4] The people who create these businesses are often referred to as entrepreneurs While definitions of entrepreneurship typically focus on the launching and running of businesses, due to the high risks involved in launching a start-up, a significant proportion of start-up businesses have to close due to "lack of funding, bad business decisions, government policies, an economic crisis, lack of market demand, or a combination of all of these."</p>
